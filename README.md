This is a small Console application that tracks turn order in a similar fashion to Roleplaying games. 

Units with a faster speed stat may lap slower units. 

It is designed to be magnitude agnostic. Speed must be in positive intigers but can be any number up to int.MaxValue. 

# Example:
Speed 100 and 120 will function the same as Speed 1 million and 1.2 million. 
As would 10 and 12. 
The faster unit lapping every 5th turn.
